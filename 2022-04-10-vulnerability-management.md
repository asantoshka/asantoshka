# Vulnerability Management 

## Introduction

While learning vulnerability management, I thought to write a blog on it. So here goes my detailed study on vulnerability management.

## What is a vulnerability ?

A vulnerability is a security flaw or weakness that allows an intruder to reduce a system’s information assurance. In simple terms, a vulnerability is a mis-configuration or weakness in the software or service, which can be exploited by a threat actor to get unauthorized access to the system. 

A vulnerability requires three elements: 

* System weakness
* Intruder’s access to the weakness
* Intruder’s ability to exploit the weakness using a tool or technique.

For example, 

* Unnecessary ports open to internet
* Insecure operating system configurations
* Outdated or unsupported third party software which may lead to multiple vulnerabilities, etc.

Note: According to various organizations and vendors, There are multiple definitions of **vulnerability** and all of them talk about weakness in a software/service/system.

Multiple new vulnerabilities are getting discovered by security researchers everyday on various softwares and opearting systems. So one might think who keeps track of these vulnerabilities and is there any standards being followed to track these vulnerabilities. To answer that we have to discuss regarding CVE - Common vulnerabilities and exposures.


### Common vulnerabilities and exposures

A CVE is a open data registry of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability in CVE list has a CVE ID or we can say various vulnerabilities are being identified using CVE IDs.  CVE IDs are assigned by CVE numbering authority(CNAs). We can find all the CVEs in the NVD - National vulnerability database, which comes under NIST - national institute of standards and technology. CVE program is primarily opearted by The MITRE corporationm, which is the primary CNA. Under MITRE there are multiple sub-CNAs. When a security researcher(s) finds a vulnerability in application/service, then it can be requested for CVE. The below image illustrates how the CVE report process works.

>Apart from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Many public sources of vulnerability definitions exist, such as  or Microsoft’s security updates and are freely available. Additionally, several vendors offer access to private vulnerability databases via paid subscription.

Using this process thousands of CVEs are released every year. However all the vulnerabilities are not same, they come with various criterias. Let's say we have 2 vulnerabilities on our system and out of which one is really complex and another is really easy to exploit. In that case, it is obvious that one should always focus on the later one as a there is a bigger chance that a threat actor will try to exploit it. To priortize the remediation of vulnerabilities a scoring system is being used, which is called as CVSS - Common vulnerability scoring system. Various other vendors use their own scoring system, however CVSS is popularly used vulnerability scoring system.

As per [First.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/), The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. 

The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability management processes.

There are various criterias using which CVSS is being calculated such as attack complexity, impact, privilege required etc. Infact there are 3 versions of CVSS and those are v1, v2, v3 and v3.1. Over the year CVSS scoring system has improved and multiple new criterias being added to the scoring system to make it more efficient and reliable. 


All the details related to CVSS scoring system can be found [here](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document). Sometimes it is really important and useful to understand the CVSS vector, CVSS metrics and scores. One can use this [calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) to calculate CVSS score of a vulnerability.

**CVSS vector:** A CVSS vector is a syntactical representation of various criterias using which the score can be calculated. For example `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N` 

```
AV - Attack Vector (AV) : N - Network
AC - Attack Complexity (AC) : L - Low
PR - Privileges Required (PR) : H - High
UI - User Interaction (UI) : N - None
S - Scope : U - Unchanged
C - Confidentiality : L - Low
I - Intigrity : L - Low
A - Availability : N - None
```

**CVSS metrics: ** 

> A zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability in a system or device that has been disclosed but is not yet patched. An exploit that attacks a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day exploit.



## What is vulnerability management ?

Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting on security vulnerabilities in systems and the software that runs on them. 

Various vulnerability management softwares are being used to perform this process. Vulnerability management softwares use vulnerability scanners or endpoint agents to find the software vulnerabilities on the servers/devices present in the network.
