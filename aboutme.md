Hey there, I am Santosh Achary. I am a cybersecurity engineer :bowtie: living in India :india: . I love to explore various technologies and learn new things in the field of information technology, to be more precise, cybersecurity. Apart from my [day-job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asantoshka/), I love traveling, exploring new places, camping, listening to music, and sometimes playing chess. Occasionally I read books, mostly self-help or non-fictional.

I spend time automating boring and repeatative tasks using my noob coding skills. Also, I play CTFs over the weekends while having some cold coffee. Sometimes I do bug-bounty. I'm not great at that, though.

I consider myself a noob, and I know it gets more interesting while learning together, so if you feel like exploring new things with me or having some chit-chat, feel free to hit my DM. Thanks

<!-- ### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
